# api-rest-demo

As part of my career path, I've been using spring and spring boot plenty of time, and I'm amazed from how easy is to write
a complete application and how much code (and time) you can save compared with a traditional J2EE application.

The goal of this didactic repo is to provide a unique project to demonstrate the use of this powerful framework covering 
as much detail as possible.

The code is plenty of comments, pay attention to them, but don't use them in a real project, they're just illustrating 
to you the use of the framework.
```
/** Doesn't have the Component annotation, instead we configure it as a Spring bean using the Bean annotation:
   {@link me.ilizin.spring_demo.springboot_demo.api_rest_demo.config.ApiRestDemoConfig} 
   The Bean annotation is useful when we take an existing third-party class and expose it as a Spring bean. */
public class SqrtEroneService implements SqrtService {

    @Override
    public int sqrt(int value) {
        //...
    }
}
```
